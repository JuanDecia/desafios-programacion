            <h1>Sweet Bread with Dry Yeast</h1>
            <p>This recipe is for a classic, enriched sweet bread—soft, slightly sweet, and perfect for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Using dry yeast makes the process accessible and reliable, as it has a longer shelf life and doesn't require proofing in most cases. The dough is enriched with ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs, and milk, which create a tender crumb and a rich flavor. Typically shaped into individual rolls or a braided loaf, it can be finished with a sugary topping or a simple egg wash glaze before baking to a golden brown.</p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Activate the Yeast Mixture: </b>In a bowl, combine the warm milk and the tablespoon of honey. Mix well. Add two tablespoons of the flour (taken from the total amount in the recipe) and mix again. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Form the Dough Base: </b>In a large mixing bowl, place the remaining flour. Make a well in the center. Place the salt around the edges of the flour. Into the well, add the sugar, the pre-beaten eggs, all the extracts (vanilla, pan dulce essence, orange blossom water), and the activated yeast mixture from step 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Knead and First Rise: </b>Mix the ingredients and knead in a stand mixer for about 5 minutes. After this time, add the softened butter and knead for another 5 minutes. The dough will become very sticky. Remove the dough from the mixer, place it in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for several hours until it has doubled in size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Add Fruits and Nuts: </b>Toast the almonds to your liking. Once the dough has risen, punch it down (deflate it). Roll it out on a floured surface into a rectangular shape. Scatter all your chosen candied fruits, nuts, and raisins evenly over the surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Incorporate the Fruit: </b>Roll the rectangle up into a log. Cut the log into portions. Then, gather all the pieces and knead them together briefly by hand. This step is to distribute the fruit evenly throughout the entire mass of dough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Shape: </b>Knead the dough one final time to form a uniform mass. Divide it into portions of approximately 250 grams each.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Second Rise: </b>Place each portion into its baking mold or tin. Cover and let them proof (rise a second time) until the dough has grown noticeably.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Bake: </b>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Before baking, brush the tops of the loaves with a wash made from one egg beaten with a little milk. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Glaze and Decorate: </b>Prepare a simple glaze by mixing powdered (confectioners'/icing) sugar with a little water until you reach a thick but pourable consistency. Once the breads have cooled slightly, drizzle the glaze over the top. Decorate with a cherry and some of the same fruits used inside the dough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Enjoy! </b>It turns out exquisite 👌, perfect for sharing or giving as a gift.
